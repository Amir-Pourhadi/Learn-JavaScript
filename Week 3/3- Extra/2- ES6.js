/* EXERCISE 2 - ES6 Syntax
 * This file is composed of a series of functions which perform operations using ES5 syntax
 * (i.e. what we referred to as "traditional" Javascript in class)
 *
 * Refactor the code below to use as many ES6 syntax as possible
 *
 * Remember to use:
 *  - let
 *  - const
 *  - template literals
 *  - default parameters
 *  - destructuring
 *  - arrow functions
