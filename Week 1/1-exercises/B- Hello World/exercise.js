/* Try to console.log() something different.
For example, 'Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!'. */
console.log("Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!");

// Try to console.log() several things at once.
console.log("Hello World.", "I'm Amir Pourhadi!", "Full Stack Web Developer");

// What happens when you get rid of the quote marks?
// console.log(Hello world);  => Error: Hello & world are not variables!

// What happens when you console.log() just a number without quotes?
console.log(25); //=> Output is number NOT a string.
